Hi Instructors,

Greetings!!!

Following are the instructions to run our program,

There are two cells in the jupyter notebook which takes a lot of time to run them.
which are performing the data cleaning of the downsampled train data and the whole data which are labelled clearly in the notebook.

So we have already cleaned the data and pushed the cleaned data into the files, 

train.tsv:
Training data given by Kaggle

test.tsv:
Test data given by Kaggle

train_proj.tsv:
Contains the cleaned data of downsampled data.

test_proj.tsv:
Contains the cleaned test data.

train_p.tsv:
Contains the cleaned data of all the records(Without down sampling)

We have given the N-grams feature extraction code(commented out) in the notebook.

Please make sure to install nltk tool kit and concerned libraries before running our code.
Our final model is specified at the last which takes the train,classes and test sets.
Gives the predictions for the test data in output.csv
which needs to be further modified to submit to kaggle which we have already done and readily provided in the file 
"output.csv"

Apart from these we have commented our findings in each cell of notebook.
